# Fully Original Neopets Website Clone
This webpage is a clone of: https://neopets.com/reg/page4.phtml

## About this Website CLone

You have probably noticed that my clone is not as identical as other website clones you've seen. This is because
I did not at _any_ point cut and paste lines code from the original Neopets website. Every bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript functionality you see was
completely handwritten by me through interaction, eyeballing and a WHOLE lot of tab cycling alone.

_Note_ This is currently ONLY  a fullscreen clone. I will go back and add media queries at a later date.

I __did not__ use Devtools to:
* Find out what display or position values were being used
* Set my sizing for anything
* Name things (naming things is hard)
* See how elements/containers were organized
* Write the Javascript Functionality

I __did__ use Devtools to:
* Get the hex values for colors.
* Get links for images
* Get some spacing/sizing references
* Save and use images, of course.
* Find font names.


## Why did I do it this way?

This might seem a little unusual (and if it's not, please let me know so I can take this sentence out ðŸ˜…), but it meant a lot to me to do it this way.

Aside from the fact that I love a challenge, as far as I'm concerned, copying code from a website and then just "making it your own" like the lessons said is plagarising and looking up the size values, javascript code, styling etc of something in the devtools is cheating. No school would accept a paper copied from another student with a few words changed. When you look up the answers
in the back of the book before even attempting the problem, you don't learn anything. I wanted to be able to look at a fairly complicated website and be able to clone it just by looking at it and interacting with it.

__I__ wanted to write the functionality for all the event listeners so I can be as efficient as possible in handling even the most weirdly specific of event listener requests.
__I__ wanted to get the styling as close as humanly possible to the original, so that later when I'm given a wireframe, I can make it look like it leapt off the page.
